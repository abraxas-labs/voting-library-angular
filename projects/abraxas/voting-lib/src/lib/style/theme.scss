  NOTE: If you want to add another theme, make sure to add it to the known themes in the ThemeService.
  Usage of :where() is needed due to specificity issues (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity)
  Without it, the basic theme declarations (such as .mat-button) would suddenly become much more specific,
  such as [data-theme='default' .mat-button) and would override some Base Components declarations.
